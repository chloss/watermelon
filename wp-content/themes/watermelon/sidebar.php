 		 	<td>After The Apology<br><br>Film<br><br>AUSTRALIA / 72 MINS / ENGLISH AND WARLPIRI WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES / DOCUMENTARY<br><br>In 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said sorry to the Stolen Generations of Indigenous people taken from their kin and country since the 1800s. Since the apology, the number of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their families has almost doubled. Through the story of four grandmothers brought together as unlikely activists in a battle they thought was long over, Behrendt chronicles the rise of a new national movement fighting to convince the government that sorry means you donâ€™t do it again. Bursting with the hopeful and resilient spirit of its remarkable subjects, After the Apology is a redemptive experience not to be missed.<br><br>This film has been rated M and is restricted to persons aged 15 and over unless accompanied by an adult.<br><br> 		 <button type="button">Buy Tickets</button> </td>
